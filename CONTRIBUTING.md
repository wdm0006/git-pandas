Contributing Code
=================

Git-pandas is a python library for analyzing git repositories with pandas.  Our goal is twofold:

 * To make the analysis of git repositories or collections of repositories simple, fast, and pleasant.
 * To give developers interested in data analysis a simple interface to datasets that they understand and have already (git data) 
 
With that in mind, we welcome and in fact would love some help.

How to Contribute
=================

The preferred workflow to contribute to git-pandas is:

 1. Fork this repository into your own github account.
 2. Clone the fork on your account onto your local disk:
 
    $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/git-pandas.git
    $ cd git-pandas
    
 3. Create a branch for your new awesome feature, do not work in the master branch:
 
    $ git checkout -b new-awesome-feature
    
 4. Write some code, or docs, or tests.
 5. When you are done, submit a pull request.
 
Guidelines
==========

Git-pandas is still a very young project, but we do have a few guiding principles:

 1. Maintain feature and API parity between Repository and ProjectDirectory
 2. Write detailed docstrings in sphinx format
 3. Slow or potentially memory intensive functions should have a limit option

Running Tests
=============

Test coverage is admittedly pretty bad right now, so help out by writing tests for new code. To run the tests, use:

    $ nosetests --with-coverage
    $ coverage html
    
Easy Issues / Getting Started
=============================

There are a number of issues on the near term horizon that would be great to have help with.

 1. Diff: it would be really nice to be able to call a function with 2 revs and return the diff as a dataframe. So columns for line number, filename, path, change, author, timestamp, etc. 
 4. File-level tracking: it would be really cool to be able to get a dataframe of one file's history in great detail. It likely would be a subset of the existing file change history function.
 5. Cross-Branch Analytics: finding differences between different branches of a single repository. Or aggregating the  results of other functions across multiple branches.
 6. Verbose Mode: add logging in more functions when verbose is set to True.
 7. Heirarchical bus factor: what's the bus factor of a file, directory, repo, project directory, etc
 8. Language analytics: what languages do we use most, what are bus factors of those languages? Who should we hire next?
